1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Onyx is a library that aims to provide implementations of on-line
classification approaches. It is written in modern C++ and Eigen, and
offers Matlab bindings.

One of the key features of Onyx is full support for state serialization
and deserialization, which allows storing and restoring the classifier
between training/testing/update sessions.


2. Methods
~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the only implemented method is a port of Antoine Bordes'
Linear LaRank code:

}


3. Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Onyx has the following dependencies:
- C++ compiler and CMake
- Eigen 3.2.5 or newer
- Boost 1.42 or newer (for the demo application)
- Matlab (for Matlab bindings)


To build onyx, use cmake; in unpacked source directory, issue:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
make
make install


4. Matlab bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable Matlab bindings, add specify the root to your Matlab
installation via the MATLAB_ROOT_DIR CMake variable, e.g.:
cmake .. -DMATLAB_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2015b -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

Matlab files - a port of the demo application, and the wrapper class -
will then be installed to ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/matlab, so make sure that
folder is in your Matlab path.

The MEX file is dynamically linked against the onyx shared library, so
you need to make sure the latter is in your library path; on Windows,
this can be achieved by manipulating PATH environment variable from
inside Matlab. On linux, the path needs to be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variable before Matlab is started.

To demonstrate the use of the wrapper class, a Matlab port of the demo
application is provided as onyx_app.m
